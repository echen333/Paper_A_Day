# Paper a Day

Started out with AI paper summaries on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chen_eddi) from 7/19/22 to 7/25/22.
 
I want to thank [Sigil Wen](https://twitter.com/0xsigil?lang=en) for giving me the idea and encouraging me to stick with it.

Note: Some math does not load in Github's markdown preview. Will try to fix this. Please let me know if there is an easy solution.

Some of my favorite paper summaries:
 - [Poincare_Embeddings](https://github.com/echen333/Paper_A_Day/blob/master/09-16%20Poincare_Embeddings.md)
 - [Optimal Offline 2/3 Edge Connectivity Problem](https://github.com/echen333/Paper_A_Day/blob/master/09-17%20Optimal_Offline_Dynamic_2_3_Edge_Connectivity.md)
